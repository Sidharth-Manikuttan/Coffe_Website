- Title of Project
  Coffee Cafe
- Problem Statement
  In today's fast-paced world, traditional methods of ordering coffee often result in long queues, inconvenience, and limited opportunities for customer engagement.    As a solution, I propose the development of a comprehensive front-end coffee shop website model that seamlessly facilitates online orders, enhances customer         experience, and fosters community engagement.
- Solutions
  The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly front-end interface for a coffee shop website, allowing customers to place orders    remotely. Additionally, the website aims to provide a platform for customers to submit reviews, interact with the coffee shop community, and explore various          offerings.The site can be used by both coffe shops and customers when it is made it a full stack project.
- Tech Stack Used
  Front-end Framework: React.js provides the foundation for building the front-end of the coffee shop website. It facilitates the creation of dynamic and interactive 
  user interfaces through its component-based architecture.
  Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the UI components of the website. Its utility-first approach offers flexibility and efficiency in styling, enabling 
  developers to quickly design and customize the appearance of the website.
- Future Plans
  In the future, the project aims to undergo expansion by integrating a backend(Using FireBase), transforming it into a full-stack application, thereby enhancing its 
  utility as a comprehensive and efficient platform catering to the needs of both the coffee shop and its customers.
